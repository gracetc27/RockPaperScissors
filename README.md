# RockPaperScissors 
Challenge 2 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. This is a simple but fun rock, paper, scissors game where the user tries to win or lose based on the opponent shown.
This was the second time building an app without tutorials in this course. My ability to think about logic behind the app and implementing that in the code was developed here.
# Features

- Practice using State.
